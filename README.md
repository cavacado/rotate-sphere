## basic physics terms:
- Rotation around the front-to-back axis is called roll. (ie 1st slider)
- Rotation around the side-to-side axis is called pitch. (ie 3rd slider)
- Rotation around the vertical axis is called yaw. (ie 2nd slider)

## range of motion of cervical spine:

The average number of degrees of motion that the cervical (cervicocranial â€“ head and neck) spine can move is:
- Flexion: 50 degrees
- Extension:  80 degrees
- Right Lateral Flexion: 45 degrees
- Left Lateral Flexion: 45 degrees
- Right Rotation: 80 degrees
- Left Rotation: 80 degrees
